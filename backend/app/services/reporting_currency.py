"""KZT aggregates expressed in a workspace's reporting currency.

Every ledger aggregate (income, spending, cash flow, net worth, budgets,
envelopes, advice) is summed in KZT — `Transaction.base_amount_kzt` and
`AssetValuation.base_value_kzt` are the one currency every row shares, because
the official NBK rates are quoted in it. The workspace, however, reports in
`AppSettings.currency`, and the frontend labels every aggregate with that
currency. This module is the single place a KZT total crosses over into the
reporting currency, so no service has to know how rates are looked up.

Rules:
- KZT reporting is the identity: amounts pass through untouched, no lookup.
- A total is converted once, after summing in KZT (never row by row), at the
  official rate for the *end of its period* — the last day of the month for a
  monthly sum, the point's own date for a timeline. A period ending in the
  future uses today's rate.
- The rate is the cached official one effective on that day: the latest cached
  rate on or before it, else the nearest later one, else — only when nothing is
  cached for the currency at all — one short, bounded NBK request. Same
  approach as dashboard_service._rate_to_kzt (the "Total balance" card), so a
  page load never waits on NBK when a rate is already known.
- No rate at all means no number: `convert` returns None and the converter
  remembers that the answer is `incomplete`, so the caller can say so instead
  of presenting a KZT sum as if it were the reporting currency.
